# EnRoute University Project

### Our Idea

The plan is to make day-to-day grocery shopping more efficient for those who don't have time to go grocery shopping or do regular shopping while at work.

### How Does Our Product Fix a Problem/What Are the Solutions?

Many people who live alone or don't have enough time to do their daily/weekly grocery, or those who are unable to do their shopping due to disability issues. The software allows anyone to Buy/Sell goods without having to leave their homes and have them delivered to their desired address. Also, during COVID-19, minimal contact helps protect customers, employees, and the public at large from the spread of the virus.

### What Does the App Do?

Customers can purchase goods and products from markets that have their products listed on the application. There are three types of clients. The first are individuals that create a market on the application and list their goods for sale to others. Second group are those who buy goods from merchants. Third group are those that deliver goods from the seller's warehouse/market to the customer's address.
